# ParallaxUIEditor
Just a UI Editor I made for my Grade 11 compsci final project.



# Features

Making basic apps using Tkinter
Exporting apps into .Py files
Data saving
Live code



# How to Use

UIEditor folder in VS Code and run UIEditor.py
The view tab has 2 options, one for editing UI in real time and another for seeing the code in real time.
You can drag the UI widgets, scroll to resize, and right click to change text.

**Export:** allows you to make your project a Python file.

**Save:** save your project as a .pxu file (.json but renamed)

**Load:** load your project from a .pxu file (If it gives you an error try restarting the app)
